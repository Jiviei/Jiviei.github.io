You can open any repository that exists in your Git storage in Gramax. To do this, go to the main page and click *Add New*, then *Load Existing*.

-  Loading a catalog is a clone of the entire repository into the computer's file system or the browser's storage.

-  When loading, the connection to the repository is automatically established in the catalog.

-  You cannot rebind a catalog to another repository.
