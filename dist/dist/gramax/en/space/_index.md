You can create multiple workspaces: for example, to separate personal catalogs from work ones.

-  By default, all catalogs are in the Gramax workspace.

-  At any time, you can change the name and icon of a workspace, as well as delete it.

-  In the desktop version, each workspace has a separate folder in the computer's file system. You cannot change this folder for an existing workspace; you can only create a new workspace.

To add a new workspace:

1. On the main page, click *Add Workspace*.

2. Specify the name and icon. In the desktop version, also choose which folder will store the catalogs in the computer's file system.

3. Load catalogs to the new workspace.
