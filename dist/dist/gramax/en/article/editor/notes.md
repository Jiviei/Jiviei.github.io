If you need to draw the readerâ€™s attention to a specific fragment -- format it as a note. For example:

:::tip Important Note

Take note!

To add a note: click the note icon in the editing panel. Then select the style, set the title, and enter the text.

## Collapsible Text

You can hide the text of a note under a spoiler -- on the Documentation Portal, the reader will need to expand it. This is useful when reference text is long but not mandatory. For example:

:::hotfixes:true Less Important Note

You can skip reading this.

To add a note with collapsible text, check the *Collapse* option.

## Quote

To format direct speech in an article, you can use the quote style. For example:

:::quote 

Don't overuse notes!
