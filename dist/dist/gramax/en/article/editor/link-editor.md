In Gramax, you can create both relative and absolute links using the visual editor.

## Relative Links

Relative links are used to link to other articles within the catalog. For example, a link to the [release notes](./../../whats-new/_index). Relative links are automatically updated when articles are moved in the navigation or if an article URL changes.

### Link to an Article

To add a link: select the word, click the link icon, and choose the article.

### Link to a Heading within an Article

To add a link: select the word, click the link icon. Then choose the article and the heading within it.

When clicking on the link, the article will open directly at this heading rather than the beginning.

## Absolute Links

Absolute links are links to a specific online resource: for example, [to our site](https://gram.ax/).

To add a link: select the word, click the link icon, and insert the URL.

## Preview the Article

Article previews allow you to view content before opening it. To do this, hover over the [relative link](./link-editor). Previews work on hover in both the editor and the reader portal.

Previews are useful when you need to explain a specific term. Create a separate article for the term and link to it.
