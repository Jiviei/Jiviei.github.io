Each section and article in the catalog opens with a specific URL. It is generated based on the [hierarchy](./hierarchy), for example: `https://gram.ax/resources/docs/article/editor/tabs`

Where:

-  `gram.ax/resources` — the website address.
-  `docs` — the catalog name.
-  `article` — the section name.
-  `editor` — the subsection name nested under `article`.
-  `tabs` — the article name.

You can change the URL of a section or article. To do this, click [icon:ellipsis] next to the title in the left navigation and modify the draft URL.

:::info URL Path in the App

The article URL in the app differs from the URL on the Documentation Portal. In the app, the URL also includes the git repository, group, branch, and repository. This is done to make it easier to share [editing links](./../collaboration/review-link). For example:

-  URL in the app — `https://app.gram.ax/gitlab.ru/dr/gramax/master/-/article/editor/tabs`
-  URL on the Documentation Portal — `https://gram.ax/resources/docs/article/editor/tabs`

Don't worry about this: on the Documentation Portal, the URL will appear as specified in the article settings.
