Catalog parameters are stored in the repository in the [file .doc-root.yaml](./doc-root-yaml). Any changes must be published [in the standard way](./../../collaboration/publish).

-  **Catalog Title** -- displayed on the homepage and in the top left corner above the navigation.

-  **Repository Title** -- displayed in links and in Git storage. Once a new catalog is published in the storage, this parameter cannot be changed. If the catalog was loaded from storage, the parameter is also locked for modification.

-  **Directory** -- the folder in the repository where the articles will be located. If left empty, a folder for the articles will be added to the root of the repository.

-  **Main Language** -- specified if versions in other languages will be added to the catalog.

-  **Display on homepage** -- style settings for the catalog tile on the homepage.
