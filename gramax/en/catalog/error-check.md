Before publishing, you can check the catalog for errors. The check displays:

-  **Links**. [Links within the catalog](./../article/editor/link-editor) that lead to a non-existent article. For example, if it has been deleted.

-  **Unsupported Elements**. Constructs in Markdown that do not comply with the Gramax standard, as well as elements that did not transfer during the [migration from Confluence](./migration/confluence).

-  **Diagrams**. [Diagrams](./../article/editor/diagrams) that Gramax cannot render. For instance, if there are syntax errors.

-  **File Structure**. Articles where the MD file header is incorrectly filled out. For example, if the articles were originally created in another system.

-  **Icons**. [Custom icons](./../article/editor/other-elements/icons) that have not been added to the catalog but are used in articles.
