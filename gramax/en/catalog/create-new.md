You can create a new catalog in Gramax. To do this, click on *Add Catalog* on the main page, then *Create New*, and a blank local catalog will appear in your [workspace](./../workspace).

- The new catalog exists only locally (on this device or in this browser) until you publish it.
- The catalog is created with draft parameters, but these [can be changed](./setting/main-parameters).
