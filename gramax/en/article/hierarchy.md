order: 3.9
title: Hierarchy
---

In the catalog's left navigation panel, you can set the hierarchy of articles.

-  You can add an article to the first level of the hierarchy (the catalog root) or nest it within a section.

-  You can nest one article inside another â€” the parent article will become a section.

-  There is no limit to the number of nested subsections, but we recommend not exceeding 5 levels.

-  You can rearrange the order of articles in the left navigation by dragging and dropping them.
