You can add a file of any format to the article. When the reader clicks on the file name, it will download to their computer. There are two ways to add a file:

-  Click the file icon in the editing panel and select it from your file system. It will be added with its name displayed. For example: [About the System \_ Gramax Docs.pdf.](<./About the System _ Gramax Docs.pdf>)

-  Highlight the text you want to attach the file to. Then, click the file icon in the additional panel and select it from your file system. The file will be added, but the name will be hidden. For example: [text with a file](<./About the System _ Gramax Docs-2.pdf>).
