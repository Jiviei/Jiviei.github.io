Snippets allow you to reuse content within a catalog and implement the single source of truth principle. When the content of a snippet is updated, the content of all articles where it is used is also updated.

-  Snippets can only be used within the same catalog.

-  Each snippet is a separate file in the repository.

-  You can view which articles use a snippet.

-  When deleting a snippet, Gramax will warn you about which articles it will also be removed from.

To add a snippet, click the snippet icon in the editing panel and fill in the fields. After saving, it will automatically be added to the article.
