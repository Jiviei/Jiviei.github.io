In Gramax, sharing a link to an article in the catalog is very easy. There is no need to export the article or catalog to DOCX or PDF; simply send the link to the user-friendly and intuitive editor in the browser.

Click *Share catalog* in the right panel or copy the link from the browser. Then send the link to someone who has access to the repository in the Git storage.

The browser version of Gramax will automatically open, loading the catalog in the selected branch.
