## Quick Start Guide for Documentation Portals with Gramax

Create awesome documentation using Markdown and Git, and discuss details with colleagues in the comments. Gramax is free and open-source forever.

### Why Choose Gramax?

If you want to deploy a public documentation portal without getting tangled in comparing Markdown with AsciiDoc or Hugo with Gatsby, Gramax is made for you.

Now you can create and publish a documentation portal in just a few steps. Gramax removes the complexities of setting up and maintaining a web portal so you can focus on writing content.

-  **Everything Out of the Box**

   WYSIWYG editor, tables, image editor, diagrams, convenient links, search, and other tools.

-  **Easy Review**

   View, edit, and comment on articles directly in the browser.

-  **Single Source of Truth**

   Avoid duplicating information on the portal. [Learn more -->]()

## Let’s See How It Works

## Launch Gramax

If you work with text regularly, it’s more convenient to have a separate application on your computer. If you occasionally check and edit other people's text, it’s more convenient in the browser.

-  Start in the browser.

-  Download the application.

## Create a Documentation Catalog

You can create a Git repository directly from the Gramax interface or upload an existing one.

1. Create your first catalog and articles.

2. Connect your cloud or local GitHub or GitLab and publish the catalog.

## Coordinate Content with Colleagues

You can open the catalog via a link and work with it like in Notion or Google Docs. You can also discuss parts of the text in comment threads.

1. Copy the link in the browser.

2. Send the link to a client.

## **Publish the Documentation Portal**

The Gramax documentation portal is a site of lightweight pages with built-in search.

-  Deploy Gramax with three commands.

-  Upload catalogs. Log in to GitHub or GitLab and upload catalogs to the portal.
