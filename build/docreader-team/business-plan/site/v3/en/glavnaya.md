## Collaborative Work

Create alternative versions of articles in branches and get approval from colleagues via a simple link. Colleagues can make edits and leave comments, while you track and manage changes.

**Image Editor**

Create stunning annotations, borders, step-by-step sequences, and descriptions directly on your screenshots, all in one cohesive style. With Gramax, there's no need for any external screenshot tools – you can crop and edit images right within our app.

## Advanced Diagrams and OpenAPI

The Gramax editor natively supports key diagram engines that version along with article text. It also supports rendering OpenAPI specifications into an interactive interface for working with your API.

-  Mermaid

-  PlantUML

-  Draw.io

Gramax operates with the Docs as Code approach. You can edit articles in Markdown and manage documentation through VSCode, IntelliJ, and other IDEs. All changes go through your Git repository.
