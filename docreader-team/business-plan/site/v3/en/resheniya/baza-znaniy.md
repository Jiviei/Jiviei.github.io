## Create a Convenient Knowledge Base for Business Users and Developers

Unify all knowledge about processes, systems, and news into a single source of truth for your company. Make changes and view documentation in a minimalist and intuitive interface.

## Enjoy Working with the Knowledge Base

The convenient visual editor of Gramax helps all employees quickly add information to the knowledge base. Developers can work with the knowledge base in Markdown files through VSCode, IntelliJ, and other development environments (IDEs).

-  **Beautiful Formatting**

   Add annotations, collapsible blocks, and large tables to articles.

-  **Links Between Articles**

   Create links to other documents with informative link previews.

-  **Single Source of Truth**

   Use the single source function to avoid duplicating information. [Learn more -->]()

## Coordinate Edits to the Knowledge Base

Create alternative versions of articles in branches and get approval from colleagues via a simple link. Colleagues can make edits and leave comments, while you track and manage changes.

## Find Answers in the Knowledge Base

The search in Gramax instantly finds the necessary information across the entire knowledge base or a specific catalog without loading screens. It accounts for keyboard layout errors, cases, and typos.

## Manage Access to Information

Gramax Enterprise Server integrates with your user directory (IAM) and allows you to configure access for employees. Once a user authenticates, they automatically receive access to preset catalogs.
