## Deploy a Beautiful Documentation Portal with Your Software in the Client's Infrastructure

Synchronize documentation with your source code.

## Replace Countless  Files

Documentation in stand alone files can be quickly prepared but is nearly impossible to keep up-to-date. Both clients and your company's employees will appreciate a modern documentation portal.

## How Gramax Works

-  **For Boxed Software**

   Deploy a product documentation portal in the client's infrastructure, which can be easily launched and updated.

-  **For Custom Developments**

   Set up a repository mirror in the client's infrastructure. Connect the documentation portal for readers and collaborate on the documentation.

## Collaborate with Clients

Create alternative versions of articles in branches and get client approval via a simple link. Colleagues can make edits and leave comments, while you track and manage changes.

## Image Editor

Create stunning annotations, borders, step-by-step sequences, and descriptions directly on your screenshots, all in one cohesive style. With Gramax, there's no need for any external screenshot tools â€“ you can crop and edit images right within our app.

## Migration from Confluence

We have made quality migration possible, so you can transfer documentation from your Confluence to Gramax in just a few clicks.
