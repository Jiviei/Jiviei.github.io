## Docs as Code Without the Hassle

Use the same systems, workflows, and approaches for working with documents as you do with code.

## Why Choose Gramax?

If you want to implement the Docs as Code approach in your company without getting tangled in comparing Markdown with AsciiDoc or Hugo with Gatsby, Gramax is for you.

Now you can create and publish public documentation in just a few steps. Gramax eliminates all the complexities of setting up and working with Docs as Code tools so you can focus on writing content.

## Convenient Visual Editor

The Gramax visual editor helps all employees quickly add information to the knowledge base. Developers can work with the knowledge base in Markdown files through VSCode, IntelliJ, and other development environments (IDEs).

-  **Beautiful Formatting**

   Add annotations, collapsible blocks, image annotations and large tables to articles.

-  **Links Between Articles**

   Create links to other documents with informative link previews.

-  **Single Source of Truth**

   Use the single source function to avoid duplicating information. Learn more -->

## Coordinate Edits to the Knowledge Base

Create alternative versions of articles in branches and get approval from colleagues via a simple link. Colleagues can make edits and leave comments, while you track and manage changes.

## Image Editor

Create stunning annotations, borders, step-by-step sequences, and descriptions directly on your screenshots, all in one cohesive style. With Gramax, there's no need for any external screenshot tools – you can crop and edit images right within our app.

## Deploy Your Documentation Portal Now

The documentation portal is easily deployed in a Docker container and synchronized with your Git repository.
